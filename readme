compiled jar - consoleapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Description
===========
- A simple console application that scraps a webpage and creates a JSON object.
- It uses selenium library and uses firefox as the browser driver.
- All the links and xpath expressions are hard coded (as constants) for simplicity
- There are two service classes 
	a) scrapper class which uses firefox driver to get the webpage data 
	b) mapper which uses jackson data mapper to convert java object to json


The project was created using Eclipse as a maven project, so can be run from Eclipse when downloaded or can be run from
command line (directory where the pom.xml is present ) using jar created consoleapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Syntax: java -cp target/consoleapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar uk.co.sainsburys.consoleapp.Consoleapp

Since the webpage uses lot of dynamic content, I have used wait times which makes the application run slow.

Areas for improvement
=====================
Configuration of the application can be improved to be more generic
Exception handling can be improved
